# Resume Setup Instructions

To add your resume to the portfolio:

1. **Add your resume file**: Place your Word document (.docx or .doc) in this folder and name it `resume.docx`

2. **File structure**: The resume should have clear sections with headers like:
   - **Experience** or **Work History**
   - **Education**
   - **Skills**
   - **Certifications**

3. **Format guidelines**:
   - Name should be the first line
   - Include email and phone number
   - Use bullet points (• or -) for job descriptions
   - Include years (e.g., 2020-2022) for dates

4. **Auto-update**: Once you add the file, the resume page will automatically parse and display the content
